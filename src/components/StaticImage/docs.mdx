The `steps` prop must be an array of objects each containing `altText`, `caption`, `srcURL` properties. These are used to build the static images.

The scrolling text content is created via a separate component which is passed in as a `slot` to the `StaticImage` component.

The child component must create html elements with a class of html elements with the class `.step`. CSS will be applied to make these at least 100vh tall and to vertially center the content.

Inside there should be a html elemnt with the class of `.step__content` and `data-index` attribute. This is used by the component's javascript to trigger the changes in the static image.

If there is an image present, it should be given a class of `.step__image` or contained within an element with that class. This will apply a 'vissually hidden' style when the screen is wider than 600px.

```
<div class="step">
	<div class="step__content" data-index="1">
		<div class="step__image">
			<img />
		</div>
		<p>...</p>
	</div>
</div>
```
